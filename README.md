This project is for the skin lesion segmentation that will be used further for the classification of skin cancer. For this project, ISIC-2017 database are using. The more details of the project and challange see the below link: 

https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/n/ISIC_2017%3A_Skin_Lesion_Analysis_Towards_Melanoma_Detection

This challange has three parts which are 
  * Part 1: Lesion Segmentation
  * Part 2: Detection and Localization of Visual Dermoscopic Features/Patterns
  * Part 3: Disease Classification
  
Currently, I am working on the first part and after getting the significant results for the segmentation I will move to next one. 
In the challenge results, it is seen that most of toppers have severall methods that are used for ensembling to get better semantic segmentation. My target is to design one end to end DCNN that will do semantic segmentation with sufficient robustness. 

More details about the implementation will be add very soon. Keep in touch :P
